# Pi BBP
ImplementsœÄ BBP-Type Formulas For Calculating the nth-digit of Pi Concurrently. Still Working on the full relatory, soon will be added to this repo.

Code Only Tested in Linux!

## üìò Usage
Can be called With using only the program name `./pi-bbp`. Or can be called directly using `./pi-bbp [algorithm] [offset] [threads]`, with algorithm beign `bellard` or `original`.

## üßÆ Formulas
* [Original BBP-Formula (4-Term)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula)

$$\pi \ = \ \sum_{k=0}^\infty \dfrac{1}{16^k} \left(\dfrac{4}{8k + 1} - \dfrac{2}{8k + 4} - \dfrac{1}{8k+5} - \dfrac{1}{8k+6}\right)$$

* [Bellard's Formula (7-Term)](https://bellard.org/pi/)

$$\pi \ = \ \dfrac{1}{2^6} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \dfrac{(-1)^k}{2^{10k}} \left(-\dfrac{2^5}{4k + 1} - \dfrac{1}{4k + 3} + \dfrac{2^8}{10k + 1} - \dfrac{2^6}{10k + 3} - \dfrac{2^2}{10k + 5} - \dfrac{2^2}{10k + 7} + \dfrac{1}{10k + 9}\right)$$

## üß∞ Build
Just use `make` and the project will build.

## ‚ö° Performance
One of the Fastest Full Open Source Implementation. Notice that y-cruncher is 1000x faster but the majority of it's code is **not** open-source.
AlL tests where made in my personal computer which have the following specs:

* **Machine**: Lenovo Ideapad 3
* **OS**: Linux Mint Victoria 21.2
* **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 5 5500U
* **Ram**: 12Gb

### ‚úÖ Results
The results are a median of 3 executions, we using the worst and best results for each algorithm and calculating it's improvement based on number of threads and in the batch size.

### üìä Offset, Threads and Batches
In the image below, we can see a graph between the two algorithms and it's permofance as more threads are added, and when more work is given to then.
